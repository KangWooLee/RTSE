Objective
=========
Our goal is to create real-time syllable emulation using Clojure and Overtone library. In current stage, we generate several consonants and all vowels to generate 'mama.'<br> we will generate ‘I love you,’ ‘Dada,’ ‘Baba,’ and ‘Papa’ in the next stage.

Technical summary
=================
We use Overtone library in Clojure for live synthesis. 

Hardware and Application
========================
PC with Clojure & Overtone <br>
